## Simulink¬Æ Models for a Simple Controller of a Pacemaker Device
#### (Benchmark Proposal)

This repository consists of two Simulink¬Æ models for the design of a simple controller of a pacemaker device. The models and requirements were developed as a part of the elective course, "SFWRENG 3MD3 - Safe Software-Intensive Medical Devices‚Äù, provided at McMaster University (Canada) for the 2021-22 academic year. A replication package folder for both Simulink¬Æ Stateflow models is included in this repository, titled as "ReplicationPackage.zip". 

### Requirements 
* MATLAB/Simulink¬Æ (R2020a and later) 
* Stateflow¬Æ
* DSP Toolbox
* S-TaLiRo <sup>1 </sup> Matlab Toolbox 
  
### File Download and Description 
 * The file *ReplicationPackage.zip* consists of two folders, *Model1* and *Model2*. The models describe different approaches to the design of a pacemaker controller. 
 * Falsification-based testing was conducted on both proposed models with different requirements. The failing and the corrected models are included in the attached replication package. 
 * To successfully replicate the experiments, S-TaLiRo <sup>1 </sup> Matlab Toolbox must be installed and *Scenario1* and *Scenario2* scripts for the models should be in different folders. 
  
### Credits and Acknowledgment 

The models included were prepared by two student groups as a part of the SFWRENG 3MD3 course:

Model 1: Akil Hamilton, Ethan Dhanraj, Namya Mehan, Rahul Anthony Sundarrajan
