## Simulink¬Æ Models for a Simple Controller of a Pacemaker Device
#### (Benchmark Proposal)

This repository consists of two Simulink¬Æ models for the design of a simple controller of a pacemaker device. The models and requirements were developed as a part of an elective course, "SFWRENG 3MD3 - Safe Software-Intensive Medical Devices‚Äù, provided at McMaster University (Canada) for the 2021-22 academic year. 

A replication package folder for both Simulink¬Æ Stateflow models is included in this repository, titled as "ReplicationPackage.zip". 

### Requirements 
* MATLAB/Simulink (R2020a) 
* S-TaLiRo <sup>1
  
### File Download and Description 
 * The file "ReplicationPackage.zip" consists of two folders, Model1 and Model2. Both models 
  
### Credits and Acknowledgment 

The models included were prepared by two groups as a part of SFWRENG 3MD3:

Model 1: Akil Hamilton, Ethan Dhanraj, Namya Mehan, Rahul Anthony Sundarrajan 

  Model 2: Abdul El-Rahwan, Akshay Mathews Jacob, Bryan Widjaja, Simon Emil Opalka, Tony
Fan

Teaching Assistant: Mostafa Ayesh

  Professor:  Claudio Menghi
  
We also thank Alan Wassyng, Guy Meyer, Michael Kehinde, for that preparing and improving the
pacemaker assignment of the 3MD3 course over the years.
