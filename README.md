## Simulink¬Æ Models for a Simple Controller of a Pacemaker Device
#### (Benchmark Proposal)

This repository consists of two Simulink¬Æ models for the design of a simple controller of a pacemaker device. The models and requirements were developed as a part of an elective course, "SFWRENG 3MD3 - Safe Software-Intensive Medical Devices‚Äù, provided at McMaster University (Canada) for the 2021-22 academic year. 

A replication package for both models is included in this repository 

### Requirements 
* MATLAB/Simulink (R2020a) 
* S-TaLiRo <sup>1
